1.	Principal Component Analysis
a.	Apply PCA on CC dataset.
 

b. Apply k-means algorithm on the PCA result and report your observation if the silhouette score has improved or not?
silhouette score = 0.7526240640619958

 
b.	Perform Scaling+PCA+K-Means and report performance.
 

2.	Use pd_speech_features.csv
a.	Perform Scaling
 



b.	Apply PCA (k=3)

 
c.	Use SVM to report performance
 


3.	Apply Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) on Iris.csv dataset to reduce dimensionality of data to k=2.
 

4.	Briefly identify the difference between PCA and LDA
PCA is an unsupervised learning algorithm while LDA is a supervised learning algorithm. This means that PCA finds directions of maximum variance regardless of class labels while LDA finds directions of maximum class separability.
